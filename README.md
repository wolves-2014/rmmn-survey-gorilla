Team Skateboard!

Ryan, Michael, Michael, & Nick's Survey Gorilla Project

Our MVP:

Our landing page will be a login page that also has the ability to sign up for a new account.

Upon logging in the user will first see the surveys that he/she has created (with options to edit or delete) followed by the list of available surveys to take.

A user can create a new survey which will allow one yes or no question. After creation they are redirected to their homepage.

A user can take any survey (via link on the homepage) which will redirect to the survey's page.

Once finished, the user will be redirected to the home page.

User can logout which returns to the login page.
